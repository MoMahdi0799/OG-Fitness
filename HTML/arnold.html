        Same as Monday, Wednesday and Friday Abs Same as Monday, Wednesday and Friday. So there you have it, the Arnold Schwarzenegger diet and workout routine. • Whole Eggs – Eggs are a tremendous source of protein and amino acids. It’s then no surprise
        that Schwarzenegger ate three to four eggs every morning, yolks and all. • Bacon or Sausage – One doesn’t exactly associate bacon and sausage with lean mass, but both foods will definitely help add calories to your diet. Plus, they’re super tasty.
        • Ezekiel Bread – Most experts say that Ezekiel bread—aka sprouted whole grain bread—is the healthiest kind you can eat. Given that it contains a range of cereal grains, two types of legumes, no added sugars, and no refined wheat, we’re inclined
        to agree. • Avocado – A bona fide miracle food, avocado delivers nearly 20 vitamins and nutrients, as well as healthy monosaturated fat. It also happens to be delicious, hence the miracle. • Oats – Whole grain oats contain both soluble and insoluble
        fibres, and have been known to improve both cholesterol levels and blood glucose levels. Schwarzenegger took his with a little honey. • Grilled Fish – It doesn’t take an Arnold Schwarzenegger diet plan to learn about the benefits of grilled fish.
        • Red Meat – Sure, it might have saturated fat, but a lean steak also has tons of protein, natural creatine, and all essential amino acids. • Grilled Lean Meat – Among bodybuilders, lean meat like chicken breast is as popular today as it was decades
        ago. • Vegetables – Everyone needs to eat their vegetables and Schwarzenegger was no exception. He also chowed down on salads. • Nuts – Schwarzenegger wents nuts for nuts, specifically almonds, cashews, and walnuts. • Sweet Potato – With each
        serving of sweet potatoes, you get healthy amounts of iron, fibre, B vitamins, vitamin C, and an anti-oxidant by the name of beta-carotene, among other things. • Brown Rice – This popular source of whole grains is not only nutritious and packed
        with fibre, but it reportedly decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes. What’s there not to love?
