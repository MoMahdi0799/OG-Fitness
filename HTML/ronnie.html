        his blood sugar levels • CoQ10 for a healthy heart • Multi-mineral • Zinc electrolytes • Calcium magnesium • Omega fatty acids • Prostate health supplements • Echinacea During his interview as a guest on comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan’s
        podcast “Joe Rogan Experience”, the 58-year-old former bodybuilder discussed several things about his bodybuilding career, training, and size. He also talked about his body fat ratio and diet, which was somewhat shocking for Rogan and viewers
        alike. Coleman said that he used to do heavy lifting and ate a lot. As a result, he put on 5-10 pounds of muscle a year. He ate 450 grams of chicken, grilled chicken breast and a half cup of rice as his everyday meal. He had about six meals a
